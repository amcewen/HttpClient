# ArduinoHttpClient

ArduinoHttpClient is a library to make it easier to interact with web servers from Arduino.

Derived from [Adrian McEwen's HttpClient library](https://github.com/amcewen/HttpClient)

## Dependencies

- Requires a networking hardware and a library that provides transport specific `Client` instance, such as:
  - [WiFi101](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFi101)
  - [Ethernet](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Ethernet)
  - [WiFi](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFi)
  - [GSM](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/GSM)

## Usage

In normal usage, handles the outgoing request and Host header.  The returned status code is parsed for you, as is the Content-Length header (if present).

Because it expects an object of type Client, you can use it with any of the networking classes that derive from that.  Which means it will work with WiFiClient, EthernetClient and GSMClient.

See the examples for more detail on how the library is used.
